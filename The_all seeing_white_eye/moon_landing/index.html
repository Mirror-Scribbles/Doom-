    <h2>July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap For Mankind!</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>"This is one small step for one man, one giant leap for mankind," said Neil Armstrong as he took his first steps on the lunar surface in July 1969. Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon and paved the way for subsequent Apollo lunar landing missions. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/july-20-1969-one-giant-leap-for-mankind/">you can review more information on the official NASA website.</a> But the big question arises, was it all really true or just a little white lie? the did landed on the moon surface or we never made it that far? well there are lots of peoplemthat thisnk otherwise!</p>
